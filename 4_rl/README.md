Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning (RL) Tutorial at the Mediterranean Machine Learning (M2L) Summer School 2024!
In this practicum we introduce fundamental concepts from RL literature with exercises on toy games provided by the Gym library. The first two notebooks do not require extensive knowledge beyond the basics of machine learning and neural networks; however, knowledge on modern Natural Language Processing (transformers, large language models) could be very helpful in order to complete part 3.

You will find theoretical explanations in each chapter that will give you enough understanding of the exercises. However, you are invited to take some time to dive in the provided learning resources if you are interested in the topic. With this tutorial we aim at introducing you to three stages in reinforcement learning research: tabular methods, policy gradient methods and finally, the intersection between Deep RL and Large Language Models to tackle complex tasks.   

### Outline

* Part I: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
  *  Environments
  *  Agent-Environment Loop
  *  Value-based Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, Greedy Agent, Eps-Greedy Agent)

* Part II: Policy Gradient Methods and Deep RL
  *  Policy definition
  *  Policy gradient algorithms (Softmax NN, REINFORCE, GPOMDP)

* Part III: Reinforcement Learning with (Any-) Human Feedback
  *  Pre-trained Language Models
  *  Using Reward Models
  *  LM fine-tuning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
  *  Drawbacks and Introduction to Preference Optimization methods
