This tutorial of the 2024 Mediterranean Machine Learning Summer School will give an insight into the basis of Computer Vision.

The tutorial is divided into three practical exercises that will show different tasks and aspects of computer vision. The exercises have different difficulties, from the easiest (beginner) to the hardest (advanced).

## Practical 1: Image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

In this practical, you will develop a simple Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.

### Outline

- Definition of the dataset class
- Design of a CNN architecture
- Creation of the training and test process

### Notebooks

## Practical 2: Semantic Segmentation with Vision Transformer

In this practical, you will develop a Neural Network for semantic segmentation based on the Vision Transformer (ViT).

### Outline

- Understanding of the Albumentation library
- Development of the Vision Transformer
