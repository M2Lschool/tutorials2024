        "======\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the tutorial of the 2024 [Mediterranean Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.m2lschool.org/) on Natural Language Processing!\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial will explore the fundamental aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Basic Python programming skills are expected.\n",
        "Prior knowledge of standard NLP techniques (e.g. text tokenization and classification with ML) is beneficial but optional when working through the notebooks as they assume minimal prior knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial combines detailed analysis and development of essential NLP concepts via custom (i.e. from scratch) implementations. Other necessary NLP components will be developed using PyTorch's NLP library implementations. As a result, the tutorial offers deep understanding and facilitates easy usage in future applications.\n",

        "* Sections marked with [📚] contain cells that you should read, modify and complete to understand how your changes alter the obtained results.\n",

        "\n",
        "This tutorial leverages [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for neural network implementation and training, complemented by standard Python libraries for data processing and the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) datasets library for accessing NLP resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "GPU access is recommended for optimal performance, particularly for model training and text generation. While all code can run on CPU, a CUDA-enabled environment will significantly speed up these processes.\n",

        "\n",
        "We show how to adapt a model that has been pre-trained on a lot of data, can be adapted to be used in a downstream task, by fine-tuning it on a target dataset. The first idea could be to consider adapting all the weights of the network to the new task, but this can be resource intensive. This could lead us to decide that we can freeze all the weights, except the final output linear layer. We will see that this results in faster training, but also in worse performance on our target task. Finally we introduce a newer way of thinking, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and one approach in that family, LoRA, that will provide us with a way to improve performance in a fine-tuning task, while being less resource intensive.\n"

One of the most popular options is called ✨ [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685), for Low-Rank adaptation of Language Models. It consists on constructing the new matrices as $\\theta = \\hat{\\theta} + A^TB$, where $\\theta$ is the new matrix of our model, the pre-trained weights $\\hat{\\theta}$ are kept fixed, and only an additive component made up by multiplying two smaller matrices $A,B$ is learned. This drastically reduces the number of parameters to train, if $A,B$ are chosen appropriately.\n",
